üìã **AI-Based Diagnostic Tool for Rare Diseases**  

üöÄ **Problem Statement**  
Develop an AI-powered diagnostic tool designed to assist doctors in identifying rare diseases. The system will analyze various forms of patient data‚Äîincluding medical history, symptoms, and lab results‚Äîto provide potential diagnoses and recommend further tests if needed.  


## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: The primary language used for development.
- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered and static web applications.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS**: Used for styling components.

## File Structure

- **app/layout.tsx**: Defines the root layout of the application with metadata.
- **app/page.tsx**: Main page of the application that includes the diagnostic tool component.
- **components/DiagnosticTool.tsx**: Component responsible for handling file uploads and processing patient data.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/A1THARV/HackOn_Codewarts.git
    cd HackOn_Codewarts
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the Application**:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

4. **Open in Browser**:
    Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.


üéØ **Objectives**  
- Accurately analyze patient data using machine learning models.  
- Identify potential rare diseases based on patterns and data correlations.  
- Offer recommendations for further diagnostic tests or specialist consultations.  
- Ensure data privacy and security in compliance with healthcare regulations (e.g., HIPAA).  

üõ†Ô∏è **Features**  
- **Automated Data Analysis:** Processes structured and unstructured medical data.  
- **Predictive Diagnosis:** Uses AI to suggest possible rare diseases.  
- **Recommendation Engine:** Suggests additional tests or treatments.  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for ease of use by healthcare professionals.  

 **Data Privacy & Security**  
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive patient data.  
- Role-based access control for different levels of user permissions.  
- Compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and other relevant regulations.  

‚úÖ **Success Metrics**  
- Diagnosis accuracy rate ‚â• 90%
